# LED-cube
We built a model of a three-dimensional LED cube with 64 LEDs (4x4x4). The purpose is to display three-dimensional effects. The transition from effect to effect is performed using a 'remote control' based on a transmitter (555 + IR) for a range of about 6 meters as well as a discrete components receiver. The system has a seven-segment display which features the number of the curent effect on the cube. The system is controlled using an Arduino-UNO control card. The effects and sounds were written in the C language of Arduino.
